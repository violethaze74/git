Git v2.37 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features

 * "vimdiff[123]" mergetool drivers have been reimplemented with a
   more generic layout mechanism.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * The performance of the "untracked cache" feature has been improved
   when "--untracked-files=<mode>" and "status.showUntrackedFiles"
   are combined.


Fixes since v2.36
-----------------

 * "git submodule update" without pathspec should silently skip an
   uninitialized submodule, but it started to become noisy by mistake.
   (merge 4f1ccef87c gc/submodule-update-part2 later to maint).

 * "diff-tree --stdin" has been broken for about a year, but 2.36
   release broke it even worse by breaking running the command with
   <pathspec>, which in turn broke "gitk" and got noticed.  This has
   been corrected by aligning its behaviour to that of "log".
   (merge f8781bfda3 jc/diff-tree-stdin-fix later to maint).

 * Regression fix for 2.36 where "git name-rev" started to sometimes
   reference strings after they are freed.
   (merge 45a14f578e rs/name-rev-fix-free-after-use later to maint).

 * "git show <commit1> <commit2>... -- <pathspec>" lost the pathspec
   when showing the second and subsequent commits, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge 5cdb38458e jc/show-pathspec-fix later to maint).

 * "git fast-export -- <pathspec>" lost the pathspec when showing the
   second and subsequent commits, which has been corrected.
   (merge d1c25272f5 rs/fast-export-pathspec-fix later to maint).

 * "git format-patch <args> -- <pathspec>" lost the pathspec when
   showing the second and subsequent commits, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge 91f8f7e46f rs/format-patch-pathspec-fix later to maint).

 * "git clone --origin X" leaked piece of memory that held value read
   from the clone.defaultRemoteName configuration variable, which has
   been plugged.
   (merge 6dfadc8981 jc/clone-remote-name-leak-fix later to maint).

 * Get rid of a bogus and over-eager coccinelle rule.
   (merge 08bdd3a185 jc/cocci-xstrdup-or-null-fix later to maint).

 * The path taken by "git multi-pack-index" command from the end user
   was compared with path internally prepared by the tool withut first
   normalizing, which lead to duplicated paths not being noticed,
   which has been corrected.
   (merge 11f9e8de3d ds/midx-normalize-pathname-before-comparison later to maint).

 * Correct choices of C compilers used in various CI jobs.
   (merge 3506cae04f ab/cc-package-fixes later to maint).

 * Various cleanups to "git p4".
   (merge 4ff0108d9e jh/p4-various-fixups later to maint).

 * The progress meter of "git blame" was showing incorrect numbers
   when processing only parts of the file.
   (merge e5f5d7d42e ea/progress-partial-blame later to maint).

 * "git rebase --keep-base <upstream> <branch-to-rebase>" computed the
   commit to rebase onto incorrectly, which has been corrected.
   (merge 9e5ebe9668 ah/rebase-keep-base-fix later to maint).

 * Fix a leak of FILE * in an error codepath.
   (merge c0befa0c03 kt/commit-graph-plug-fp-leak-on-error later to maint).

 * Avoid problems from interaction between malloc_check and address
   sanitizer.
   (merge 067109a5e7 pw/test-malloc-with-sanitize-address later to maint).

 * The commit summary shown after making a commit is matched to what
   is given in "git status" not to use the break-rewrite heuristics.
   (merge 84792322ed rs/commit-summary-wo-break-rewrite later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge e6b2582da3 cm/reftable-0-length-memset later to maint).
   (merge 0b75e5bf22 ab/misc-cleanup later to maint).
   (merge 52e1ab8a76 ea/rebase-code-simplify later to maint).
